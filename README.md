# -PRODIGY_WD_2-
This code creates a responsive web page with a fixed top navigation bar that changes background and text color when the user scrolls down. It includes five sections (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact) and uses JavaScript to detect scroll and toggle a CSS class (scrolled) that styles the navbar. It's optimized for both desktop and mobile.
